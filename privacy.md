TRX Wallet Bot (“we”, “us”, or “our”) is committed to safeguarding your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect the personal information you share with us while using our Telegram-based services.

## 1. 🔐 Information We Collect

We may collect and store the following information:

- **Telegram User ID & Public Profile**: For account identification and user interaction.

- **Gameplay & Transaction Records**: Includes bet history, game types, exchange amounts, and related interactions.
- **In-App Balances**: STAR and TRX balances are tracked within the bot to facilitate gameplay and exchanges.

---

## 2. ⚙️ How Your Data Is Used

Your data is used exclusively to:

- Enable wallet generation and management.
- Facilitate automatic TRX → STAR transfers from your wallet to our system wallet.
- Power emoji-based dice games using Telegram’s native randomness.
- Allow TRX ↔ STAR in-app exchange functionality.
- Provide real-time cryptocurrency price lookups.
- Let users query TRON blockchain data (wallet addresses & hashes).
- Improve service quality and prevent misuse.

We take data protection seriously:

- Telegram’s secure infrastructure ensures safe communication.
- We do **not** sell, rent, or share any user information with external entities.

## 5. 🌍 Blockchain Transparency

As the TRON blockchain is public by nature:

- All wallet addresses and transaction hashes (TRX & USDT-TRC20) are inherently visible on-chain.

We value your data rights:

- You may request deletion of your wallet and associated data at any time.
- We do **not** use your data for advertising, profiling, or external sharing.
- Data is retained only for operating in-bot services and functionality.
